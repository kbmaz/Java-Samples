\f0\fs24 \cf0 Guessing game is actually a matching game.  The only part of the code we are to write is the game logic method.  When I run this I get the boxes masked in black.  When I click on a box I get all kinds of errors.  I\'92m not sure where to start in fixing the code in this method.  Any help you can give will be appreciated. \
